# ðŸ›’ Retail Inventory Analytics with Python

![Retail Inventory Cover](cover.png)

## ðŸŽ¥ Project Overview

In this video walkthrough, I demonstrate how **data analytics** can be leveraged to solve one of retailâ€™s most pressing challenges â€” **overstocking and understocking**. By analyzing **inventory data from Kroger**, I identify which products are consistently overstocked or understocked, providing actionable insights for better inventory control.

This analysis plays a key role in making **informed business decisions** that support operational efficiency and long-term growth. While no direct action is requested from viewers, the video is packed with valuable context for anyone interested in **inventory management and retail analytics**.
